# PLL Frequency synthesiser

This project is a PLL frecuency sintetizer based in the CD4046B chip made for a subject in 2019. 
The requirements was:
- Generator frequency range: 3 kHz to 999,9 kHz in 1 kHz steps.
- Separation amplifier allowing isolation of the synthesiser from the output.
- Three (3) position output attenuator with constant output impedance.
- Output level indicator.
- Digital frequency selector.

Inside this folder are the PCB schematic and gerber files.
